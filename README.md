# iOS9Colors
UIColor+iOS9Colors

Here you will find a UIColor category with the 15 flat colors used by the Maps application on iOS 9 in the search categories feature. This makes a great set for using in your own app targeting the iOS 9 UI theme. I had tried previous flat color sets but nothing looked as good as Apple's own flat colors used in Maps, so I thought I would create the set and share them here. Here are examples of all the colors, note some are duplicated:
